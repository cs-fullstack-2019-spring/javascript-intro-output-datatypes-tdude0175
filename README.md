Create an HTML file called ```index.html`` 

Add JavaScript inline (using <script> tags) that does the following:

* Defines a string variable called ```name``` and assign it your name

* Defines a numeric variable called ```age``` that contains your age

* Write the code to log ```My name is YOURNAME and I am YOURAGE``` in the developer console

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>First assignment</title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
var name = "Thomas";

var age = 22;

    console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age);
</script>

</body>
</html>
